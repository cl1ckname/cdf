# CDF - üìÅ OS path bookmarks manager

**CDF** is a fast and efficient terminal-based CLI tool, written in Go, designed to perform a single task with precision and simplicity. Following the Unix philosophy of "do one thing, but do it well," cdf has zero dependencies and provides a minimalistic solution to a specific problem. Its lightweight nature ensures that it integrates seamlessly into any Unix-like environment, delivering a reliable and focused user experience.

## Install
Using Go:

```console
go install github.com/cl1ckname/cdf@latest
```

Right now there is no way to get a prebuilt binary, but work is actively underway on this. For now, you can compile and install the utility yourself.

### Get the binary

Clone repository using git command

```console
git clone https://github.com/cl1ckname/cdf
```

Cd to it

```console
cd cdf
```

Install binary to `$GOBIN`

```console
make install
```

### Integrate it to shell
The process of integrating SDF into different shells varies slightly. But in general, the point is to add the appropriate line to the end of your shell configuration file.

<details>
<summary>Bash</summary>
Add this to end of your <code>.bashrc</code> file

```bash
eval "$(cdf shell bash)"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Fish</summary>
Add this to end of your <code>.config/fish/config.fish</code> file

```bash
cdf shell fish | source
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Zsh</summary>

## Usage
The CDF should be treated as a list of bookmarks in the browser, not as a search bar, unlike similar projects the CDF does not collect any data on its own, so the user himself must add points for quick navigation. 
### Add mark
The first step in using the program is to add a mark at cwd

```console
cdf add home
```

You can specify mark directory

```console
cdf add home /home/username
```

Both absolute and relative paths can be used for this

```console
cdf add projects ./projects # in /home/username/projects
```

### List marks

The list of brands can be easily retrieved by the `list` command

```console
cdf list
```

The next text will be printed

```
home		/home/username
projects 	/home/username/projects
```

### Jump to mark
To move to the defined mark, use a shortened version of the command with the path alias

```
f home # we're in /home/username now
```

## Why not just use Z or Jump?

The short answer - it is different. 

The long answer is - well, that's really something else entirely. CDF uses only precisely marked points. The user does not need to heuristically evaluate how this or that incomplete path will resolve for him. Fuzzy Search is wonderful and is definitely comfortable to use. But there is such a way to guarantee yourself a quick result, even if only for a couple of symbols. Use them both to achieve unprecedented productivity!
